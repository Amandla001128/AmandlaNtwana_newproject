<p>
    Sea Point is a great combination of residential and commercial properties. Homes and holiday accommodation range from holiday apartments and penthouses overlooking the sea to mansions, historical homes, and Sea Point hotels that are perfect for newlyweds and families.

    Its main road slices through Sea Point and boasts loads of shops, eateries, caf√©s, clubs and fast-food takeaways.
    
    Sea Point is flanked by Signal Hill and the Atlantic Ocean, and is only minutes away from the centre of Cape Town, the V & A Waterfront, and the CTICC. In fact, much of Sea Point climbs the gentle slope of Signal Hill, giving the homes and accommodation here a fantastic view over the city and the sea.
